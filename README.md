# Multimodal Deep Learning for Stock Price Forecasting: A Fusion-Based Framework

## Project Overview
This project explores a multimodal deep learning approach to forecast short-term **stock returns** by combining **numerical** (market indicators) and **textual** (Reddit sentiment) data.  
It compares traditional machine learning models like **Ridge Regression** with deep learning-based **LSTM** and fusion architectures integrating **SBERT embeddings** for sentiment analysis.

The objective is to demonstrate how fusing diverse data modalities can enhance the accuracy and interpretability of stock price forecasting.

## Key Features
- **Numerical Modeling:** Ridge Regression and LSTM models using OHLCV-based financial indicators.
- **Textual Modeling:** SBERT (MiniLM-L6-v2) embeddings of Reddit headlines as sentiment features.
- **Fusion Strategies:** Early, Late, and Attention-Based fusion for integrating modalities.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, and Directional Accuracy (DA) with bootstrap confidence intervals.
- **Reproducibility:** Fully open-source implementation with documented dependencies and dataset preprocessing.

## Model Summary
| Model | Description | Key Findings |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------|
| **SN (Seasonal Naïve)** | Statistical benchmark repeating past seasonal patterns | High error, no predictive value |
| **RB (Ridge Baseline)** | Linear regression with L2 regularization | Strong baseline for numerical features |
| **LSTM** | Captures temporal patterns in price data | Similar to Ridge — numerical data mostly linear |
| **MEF (Early Fusion)** | Concatenates modalities before dense layers | Slight reduction in MAE and RMSE |
| **MLF (Late Fusion)** | Combines predictions post-encoding | **Best overall performance (highest DA)** |
| **MAF (Attention Fusion)** | Uses cross-modal attention | Comparable to other fusion methods |

## Results Summary
| Model | MAE | RMSE | DA (%) |
|:------|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| SN | 0.017734 | 0.023151 | 49.710145 |
| RB | 0.012199 | 0.016520 | 50.362319 |
| MEF | 0.011432 | 0.015759 | 49.658770 |
| MLF | 0.011444 | 0.015729 | 53.802733 |
| MAF | 0.011449 | 0.015783 | 49.658770 |

The **Late Fusion (MLF)** model achieved the best trade-off between numerical precision and directional accuracy.

## Reproducibility
This project ensures reproducibility by providing access to the data, code, and methodology.  
The code and cleaned dataset are available at **[GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/Soumabha4444/MLBA_Project_57C)**.  

To replicate the results:
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies (`environment.yml`)  
3. Run the main script or notebook  
All dependencies and software versions are documented in the environment file and README.

## Limitations and Future Work
- FinBERT could not be implemented due to system resource constraints (GPU memory).  
  Future iterations will include FinBERT-based sentiment embeddings for domain-specific understanding.  
- Expanding datasets across multiple tickers could improve model generalization.  
- Incorporating transformer-based temporal models (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer) may enhance long-range trend learning.
